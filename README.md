“ZaykaBox is an impressive and feature-rich food delivery web application that delivers a smooth, modern, and user-first experience. From restaurant discovery to food categories, discounts, live tracking feel, and customer reviews — every section is thoughtfully designed and visually appealing.
The interface feels premium, fast, and highly responsive, clearly reflecting strong skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.”

The Food Category section is well-organized with a wide variety of dishes (Indian, Chinese, snacks, beverages), creating a realistic food app experience.
The Restaurant Listing cards are clean and professional with ratings, locations, deals, and table-booking options — very similar to real-world platforms like Swiggy or Zomato.

The Testimonials section adds trust and authenticity, and the footer includes everything a real brand would have: company info, support, legal policies, and city availability.

Overall, this project demonstrates:

Excellent UI/UX design

Smooth layout and color balance

Realistic food delivery branding

Well-structured content

Professional presentation

Strong front-end development skills

A high-quality project that feels production-ready.
